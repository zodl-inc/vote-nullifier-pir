# Unreleased

- Move the `upstream` (LRZ) backend of `pir-types` and `pir-client` to the
  `orchard` `0.16` generation of the librustzcash crates: `pasta_curves` `0.6`
  and `halo2_gadgets` `0.6`. Under `upstream`, `Fp` values exchanged with these
  crates are `pasta_curves` `0.6` types.
- Require `voting-crypto-deps` `^0.2.4` instead of `=0.2.4`.
- `imt-tree` moved to the
  [voting-circuits](https://github.com/valargroup/voting-circuits) repository,
  next to `voting-crypto-deps`. Consumers use the published crate as before.
- `nf-server verify-root` parses raw blocks with `zakura-primitives` `2.0`
  under the default Zakura backend and with `zcash_primitives` `0.31.0-pre.1`
  under `upstream`, instead of `zakura-chain`. It now also rejects a block whose
  coinbase consensus branch does not match its height on the selected network.

# v0.12.2

- Align with `voting-circuits` `0.12.2` by upgrading
  `voting-crypto-deps` to `0.2.4` and the Zakura cryptography libraries to
  `2.0.0`.
- Add external PIR query probes with persistent Slack alerting for production
  endpoint health.
- Add a read-only script and AI guide for verifying the latest registered or
  selected voting round, including unapproved rounds. Combine the canonical
  round-ID check with a fresh rebuild using PIR's normal lightwalletd sync and
  tree construction, require the exact snapshot height, and print the root
  comparison. The guide provides public stage and mainnet endpoint defaults
  and resolves its `main` link to one commit for each run. Authenticated
  raw-block verification remains available with `--mode raw-blocks`; existing
  raw-block script invocations must add that flag.

# imt-tree 0.5.4, pir-types 0.6.4, and pir-client 0.7.4

- Publish the Zakura `2.0.0` cryptography backend through
  `voting-crypto-deps` `0.2.4`.

# v0.12.1

- Update the `pir-apm` monitoring sidecar automatically from its own service,
  following the same release tag as the served binary so the two cannot drift
  apart. The sidecar is not covered by coordinator signatures, because it never
  answers a PIR query; its artifacts are verified against the release
  `SHA256SUMS`. The service is installed only on Valargroup fleet hosts, so
  other operators are unaffected and receive no sidecar.
- Report a Tier1 latency check that cannot evaluate, instead of leaving it
  silently unable to fire when the server exports no processing histogram.
  Record the scraped server's release tag so a sidecar running against a
  different server version is visible directly.
- Publish `pir-apm` for linux-arm64, and publish the sidecar updater as a
  release artifact so a host can be provisioned from a release.
- Keep `SENTRY_RELEASE` in step with the activated tag on hosts enrolled in
  signed updates, where the deployment workflow can no longer maintain it.

# v0.12.0

- Use `voting-crypto-deps` `0.2.3` and the Zakura `1.2.0` cryptography
  libraries, as introduced in `v0.12.0-rc.2`.
- Add `nf-server verify-root` for independent Ironwood root verification from
  raw blocks.
- Add optional automatic binary and snapshot updates authorized by valargroup
  coordinator signatures, with separate staging and production key pins.
  Verify artifact hashes before activation, check readiness, and roll back
  failed updates.
- Add a one-command updater installer that enrolls existing Linux installations
  and applies the signed target, preserving service configuration and recovering
  interrupted enrollment. Identify updater HTTP requests to the configuration
  gateway.
- Expose the running release tag, build identity, and updater state through
  server metadata and metrics.
- Fix deployments to beta PIR hosts.
- Keep legacy PIR rollback on its original local snapshot, including after a
  reboot or loss of the configuration endpoint. A recovery override remains until
  enrollment is retried or an operator restores manual discovery.
- Prevent manual installation, GitHub deployment, and restart workflows from
  changing hosts enrolled in signed updates; serialize manual operations with
  enrollment and automatic updates.

# v0.12.0-rc.2

- Align with `voting-circuits` `0.12.0-rc.2` by upgrading
  `voting-crypto-deps` to `0.2.3` and the Zakura cryptography libraries to
  `1.2.0`.

# imt-tree 0.5.3, pir-types 0.6.3, and pir-client 0.7.3

- Publish the Zakura `1.2.0` cryptography backend through
  `voting-crypto-deps` `0.2.3`.

# v0.11.2

- Align with `voting-circuits` `0.11.2` by upgrading `voting-crypto-deps` to
  `0.2.2` and the Zakura cryptography libraries to `1.0.0`.

# imt-tree 0.5.2, pir-types 0.6.2, and pir-client 0.7.2

- Publish the stable Zakura `1.0.0` cryptography backend through
  `voting-crypto-deps` `0.2.2`.

# v0.11.1

- Align the PIR cryptography backend with `voting-circuits` `0.11.1` by
  upgrading `voting-crypto-deps` to `0.2.1` and Zakura cryptography RC.5.
- Require Rust 1.91 across workspace packages, CI, release builds, and the PIR
  APM sidecar.

# imt-tree 0.5.1, pir-types 0.6.1, and pir-client 0.7.1

- Publish the Rust 1.91-compatible public PIR crates against
  `voting-crypto-deps` `0.2.1`.

# v0.11.0

- Split Tier1 body receive latency from server processing latency in PIR APM,
  and page only when server processing after upload exceeds its latency budget.
- Align the PIR cryptography backend with `voting-circuits` `0.11.0` by
  upgrading `voting-crypto-deps` to `0.2.0` and Zakura cryptography RC.4.

# imt-tree 0.5.0, pir-types 0.6.0, and pir-client 0.7.0

- Update the public PIR crates to `voting-crypto-deps` `0.2.0`, preserving the
  existing `zakura` and `upstream` feature names over the new `vct` and
  `lrz-vct` backend features.

# v0.0.45

- Add privacy-preserving PIR APM metrics for the tier0 and tier1 client
  endpoints without recording client identifiers.
- Add the `pir-apm` host sidecar with a dashboard, host and service health
  summaries, coded outlier thresholds, and Slack alert/recovery notifications.
- Restyle the PIR APM dashboard in the Valar Group visual language, add a
  headline KPI strip, grade endpoint latency against the same budgets that
  drive alerts, and refresh in place instead of hard-reloading the page.
- Serve the PIR APM dashboard without authentication. Deploys remove the Caddy
  basic-auth credentials, so `/apm/` is reachable by anyone who knows the URL
  and `PIR_APM_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` is no longer used.
- Package and deploy the sidecar through the existing release and
  environment-targeted fleet workflows.
- Block public `GET /tier1/row/*` at Caddy. That debug route is not
  privacy-preserving and must not reach `nf-server` through the public proxy.

# v0.0.44

- Bump `voting-crypto-deps` to `0.1.2` so Zakura builds use cryptography RC.3.
- Take `ff` traits through `pasta_curves::group::ff` so Zakura (`ff` 0.14) and
  upstream (`ff` 0.13) backends stay mutually exclusive without a shared pin.
- Log successful `nf-server` readiness locally instead of creating an
  Info-level Sentry issue. Snapshot-stale and recovery events now share an
  explicit routing tag, and recovery reports the last nonzero gap.

# imt-tree 0.4.0, pir-types 0.5.0, and pir-client 0.6.0

- Depend on `voting-crypto-deps` `0.1.2` (Zakura RC.3) and import field traits
  via the selected pasta backend instead of a direct `ff` crate pin.

# v0.0.43

- Default PIR and IMT builds to the Zakura voting crypto backend while retaining
  an explicitly selectable and tested upstream backend.
- Route default PIR and voting-config reads through the GitHub-primary
  `voting.valargroup.dev` gateway with its Cloudflare fallback.

# imt-tree 0.3.0, pir-types 0.4.0, and pir-client 0.5.0

- Add mutually exclusive Zakura and upstream crypto backends, with Zakura as
  the default and minimal VCT-only dependency sets in both modes.

# v0.0.42

- Released the exact `v0.0.42-rc.1` server implementation as stable without
  implementation changes.

# pir-types 0.3.0 and pir-client 0.4.0

- Released the exact `pir-types 0.3.0-rc.6` and `pir-client 0.4.0-rc.7`
  implementations as stable without API or wire-format changes.

# v0.0.42-rc.1

- Advertise the process-configured YPIR degree at both
  `/root.pir_layout.poly_len` and `/params/tier1.poly_len` so clients can
  require one layout identity across signed configuration and the server
  handshake.

# pir-types 0.3.0-rc.6 and pir-client 0.4.0-rc.7

- `PirLayout` now includes `poly_len` (2048 or 4096; missing snapshot metadata
  deserializes as `DEFAULT_YPIR_POLY_LEN`). Serving `/root` overwrites it with
  the process-configured YPIR degree so wallets authenticate degree as part of
  the layout handshake.
- `PirClient::with_transport` / `PirClientBlocking::with_transport` take a single
  `expected_layout` and fail closed when `/root.pir_layout` or
  `GET /params/tier1` disagrees (including `poly_len`).

# v0.0.42-alpha.2

- Default YPIR lattice dimension to 4096 and advertise `poly_len` on
  `/params/tier1` (responses that omit the field stay legacy degree 2048).
- Depend on released `valar-ypir` 0.2.0 from crates.io.
- Limit PIR query request bodies to 2 MiB.
- Disable Sentry tracing in `nf-server` so proxy-added client identity headers,
  request timing, and PIR request cardinality are not exported. Process error
  reporting and explicit startup/watchdog messages remain enabled.

# pir-types 0.3.0-rc.5 and pir-client 0.4.0-rc.5

- Advertise and negotiate YPIR polynomial degree via `YpirScenario.poly_len`
  (server default 4096; responses that omit the field deserialize as legacy
  2048).
- Depend on `valar-ypir` 0.2.0 and construct YPIR clients with
  `YPIRSPConfig::for_poly_len` for supported degrees 2048 and 4096.

# v0.0.42-alpha.1

- Make two-tier PIR geometry runtime-driven: clients accept any valid
  `PirLayout` that matches `/root` (and passes geometry / YPIR / circuit
  bounds) instead of requiring equality against `COMPILED_PIR_LAYOUT`.
  Production default remains 12+7; `COMPILED_PIR_LAYOUT` is only the default
  export/advertise identity.
- Require `pir_layout` on `pir_root.json` / `PirMetadata` (breaking for
  snapshots that omit it). Export writes it; server load and export
  completeness checks derive expected `tier0`/`tier1.bin` sizes from that
  layout.
- Parameterize Tier 0 / Tier 1 readers and path assembly by negotiated
  layout; covered by reconstruct + connect tests for 11+8, 12+7, and 13+6.
- Add explicit depth and tier-split metadata to `/root`, and require PIR client
  construction to match the dynamic-config layout against the server before
  any private query.
- Rename the depth-specific `root25` and `root29` fields to `pir_root` and
  `circuit_root`; legacy metadata field names remain accepted as aliases.
- Accept `-alpha.N` release tags as prereleases without updating GitHub Latest
  or mutable installer aliases.
- Always issue a Tier 1 PIR request when Tier 0 routing fails or panics,
  preventing malicious routing metadata from leaking nullifier ranks through
  request counts.
- Add held stable releases and a verified manual promotion path so coordinated
  PIR upgrades can publish tag-scoped artifacts without changing installer
  aliases early, then promote every alias without permitting a stale rollback.
  Ordinary stable releases become Latest only after those aliases are published.

# pir-types 0.3.0-rc.3 and pir-client 0.4.0-rc.3

- Replace the depth-25, two-query PIR tree with the Ironwood-sized depth-19
  12+7 layout and a single PIR round trip.
- Require dataset contract v2 and validate tier geometry before serving or
  querying snapshots.

# pir-types 0.3.0-rc.2 and pir-client 0.4.0-rc.2

- Add Zcash network identity to Ironwood ingestion, snapshot artifacts, and `/root` responses.
- Keep RC installers tag-scoped; stable tags update the latest aliases.

# pir-types 0.3.0-rc.1 and pir-client 0.4.0-rc.1

- Switched PIR ingestion, artifacts, bootstrap metadata, and clients to an Ironwood-only dataset identity. Existing raw datasets require one explicit reset.

# 0.2.0

- Added a `pir_client::Transport` trait and `TransportResponse` type so consumers can provide their own HTTP stack.
- Removed the built-in `reqwest` HTTP client. Consumers now construct clients with `PirClient::with_transport` or `PirClientBlocking::with_transport`.

# 0.1.1

- Initial published PIR client release.
